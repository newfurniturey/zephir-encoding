Encoding Utilities
---

PHP Extension to introduce basic string encoding utilities available to all applications!

#### Installation

Compile the `utils` extension with:

    git clone https://github.com/newfurniturey/zephir-encoding.git
    phpize
    ./configure
    make
    make install

#### Notes:

This isn't meant to actually be used, it's just me playing around and testing out the [Zephir Language](http://zephir-lang.com/) for PHP extension development =]
